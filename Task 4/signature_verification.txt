The message is signed by Alice's private RSA key. 
When Bob receives the email, he verifies the signature using Alice's public key.

If the signature is valid, it shows that:
1) The message really came from the owner of the private key (authentication of the sender).
2) The message was not changed after it was signed (integrity), because any change would make the signature check fail.

In this simulation, the file signed_message.asc contains the digital signature of original_message.txt.
The program uses the public key in public.asc to verify the signature before decrypting the message.
