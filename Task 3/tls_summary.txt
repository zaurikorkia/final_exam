How TLS Provides Confidentiality and Integrity

Confidentiality:
TLS protects data by encrypting it with symmetric encryption algorithms such as AES.
This ensures that even if the traffic is intercepted, attackers cannot read the data.

Integrity:
TLS ensures data integrity by using cryptographic hashing and authentication mechanisms.
If any data is altered during transmission, the connection will detect the change.

In summary, TLS keeps data private and prevents unauthorized modification.
